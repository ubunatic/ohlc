# Generic Python Packaging Makefile
# ---------------------------------
# Contains setuptools and twine targets for building and publishing a package to PyPi.
# Copy this your project and use it via `make -f setup.mk`.

help:
	# Usage:
	#     make -f setup.mk TARGETS
	#
	# Main Targets:
	#     test-wheels   build and test python wheels
	#     test-publish  build and test wheels and publish to testpypi
	#     sign          GPG sign the python wheels
	#     publish       build wheels and publish to pypi
	#
	# Variables:
	#     WHEELS        python wheels to publish (defaults to all whl-files in ./dist)
	#     PY            major Python version to use
	#     TAG           additional build tag to use for the wheels
	#
	# Defaults:
	#     WHEELS:       $(WHEELS)
	#     PY:           $(PY)
	#     TAG:          $(TAG)

# Main Targets
# ------------
# The following targets are used from the command line during development.
# The other targets are mostly depending targets and need not to be used directly.
test-wheels: install test uninstall

	twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

sign:
	# sign the wheels with your gpg key
	gpg --detach-sign -a dist/*.whl

	# wheels: $(WHEELS)
